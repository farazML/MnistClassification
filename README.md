# MnistClassification

you can use this code to classify mnist dataset.
we are using mnist dataset from keras datasets, you can use your own handwritten numbers images instead dataset that we used. 
i suggest play with model and fine tuning parameters that we are given to model to get more better accuracy and less loss.
